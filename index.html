			<h3>Why do you want to be a designer? </h3>
			<section>
			<p>I want to be a designer because I like designing. I’ve always been into making things look visually appealing. I originally tried taking computer programming and I found myself more interested in the design aspects of our work. When we did group work, my teammates would focus more on the coding while I took on the designing. </p>
		</section>

		
			<h3>What makes you nervous about becoming a designer? </h3>
			<section>
			<p>There are quite a few things about becoming a designer that make me nervous and I’m sure a lot of people share the same fears with me. First is learning to work with clients.  You never know who you’re going to get, and I always have this big fear that I won’t be able to deliver what they want. Another thing I’m nervous about is making a mistake and not being able to catch it until after the final product has already been made and is out there for everyone to see. 
</p>

			<h3>What excites you about design? </h3>
			<section>
			<p>I love creating something that just looks awesome. I like the idea of making something that is considered good enough to someone that they would want to use it to represent whatever they’re trying to sell or communicate. When I create something I’m proud of I take pictures or screenshot it and send it to a set of people because I can’t help but want to show it off. If I make or see something I really like, I will sit and admire it, go off and do something else, and then come back to admire it some more. 
</p>
		
			<h3> What are your strengths? </h3>
			<section>
			<p> I feel like I’m good at being able to follow trends and techniques. Once I get some inspiration and start going on a project, I get really into it and put a lot of attention into little details. Sometimes I think I spend a little too much time on the little things, but it’s always good to give everything in your design attention. </p>

			<h3>What are some areas of opportunity to work on? </h3>
			<section>
			<p> One thing I really want to work on is developing my own style. I feel like I’m good at being able to follow trends and recreate things, but I would like to be able to have a style that’s all my own and have some consistency within all my work. I’d also like to be able to work better in public space or around other people. I tend to get self-conscious when working around others which really slows down my progress. </p>

			<h3>What aspects of graphic design do you gravitate towards?</h3>
			<section>
			<p>I enjoy working with flat vectors in Illustrator. Illustrator is probably my favorite Adobe program. I also like web design as I already have some prior experience with it. It can be frustrating trying to get it to do what you want sometimes, but you can do so much with it.</p>



		</section>
		
			<h3>What are the roles and responsibilities of a graphic design in society? </h3>
			<section>
			<p> Graphic design is responsible for communicating with society. It says, “Hey, buy me!” or "Don’t go there!” Graphic design is meant to tell you something or make you want to do something. If someone is confused by it, or goes against what the designer was going for, then the design has failed. </p>



		</section>
		
			<h3>When/where/why are you at your most creative/productive? </h3>
			<section>
			<p>I am definitely one of those people who treats their work as “diamonds made under pressure”. Because I’m self-conscious of my work, I work best when I’m by myself at home as opposed to in a classroom with other people. Sometimes, I’ll have inspiration right away or just know what I want to do for a project. Other times, I sit and stare at a blank page or screen until inspiration hits. But once I get into the workflow, I can work for hours. </p>



		</section>
		
			<h3>What are your comfort levels with giving and receiving feedback? How might you improve your skills here? What strategies have worked for you? </h3>
			<section>
			<p>I feel fairly nervous when it comes to giving and receiving feedback. I obviously don’t want to hurt another person’s feelings when critiquing their work, but I also want to do my part in helping them see things from another person’s perspective. I also appreciate input from others as it helps me consider new ideas I may never have thought of on my own.</p>




		</section>
		
			<h3>What is a website? </h3>
			<section>
			<p>A website can be anything you want it to be. It can be a place to share news and information, it can be a place where you buy or sell things, it can be a place to teach and learn. A website is something that connects us to other people and other places around the world.</p>
